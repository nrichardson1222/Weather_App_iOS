# Weather App iOS

An app from the Udemy Course by Angela Yu with a few modifications. This app uses https://openweathermap.org/ API to fetch real time weather data. The app allows the user to obtain weather by searching for location through typing in a UITextField or by using the CLLocationManager which obtains the weather conditions at the longitude and latitude of the device. This app was useful for helping me learn how to use the delegate design pattern and protocols. I also became very familiar with API calls and how to make http requests with URLSession. I also learned how to parse JSON data using JSONDecoder.
